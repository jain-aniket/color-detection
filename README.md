# color-detection
**color-detection is a program that allows the user to filter out pixels with color values between a given range.**

cccccThe program uses on-screen sliders to select a range of accepted color values in the RGB color space.  
On the left side of the program is depicted the original image, and on the right, a real-time editing view of the resulting image after filter. 

The program is primarily built based on two programs by [PyImageSearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/04/opencv-python-color-detection/) and [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_trackbar/py_trackbar.html), combined together by myself to make this program. 

If wanted, argparse could be added to use command line input for the file modified, but currently the program runs by pasting the file path in the code.
